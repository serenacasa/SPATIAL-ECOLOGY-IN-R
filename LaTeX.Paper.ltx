    R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics supported by the R Core Team and the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Created by statisticians Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R is used among data miners, bioinformaticians and statisticians for data analysis and developing statistical software.[7] The core R language is augmented by a large number of extension packages containing reusable code and documentation.

% to eliminate the indentation we can use \noindent at the start of the paragraph.

% to increase the font, we can code with a quadratic parenthesis that in LaTeX is used for something structural 

\section{Methods}
for this thesis, I made use of the following formula:
\begin{equation}
    a = b+ c
    \label{eqSum}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    F=\sqrt[3]{G\frac{m_1\times m_2}{d^2}}
    \label{eqNewton}
\end{equation}
starting from equation \ref{eqSum}
as we seen in Equation \ref{eqNewton}, blablabla

as we have seen in Section \ref{secIntro}

\section{Results}


\section{Discussion}
let's cite in this section

The main achievements of this thesis can be summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Graphical representation of species distributions
    \item Statistical analysis of uncertainty
    \item Literature review on the theme
\end{itemize}

We might also make use of numbers:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Graphical representation of species distributions
    \item Statistical analysis of uncertainty
    \item Literature review on the theme
\end{enumerate}
