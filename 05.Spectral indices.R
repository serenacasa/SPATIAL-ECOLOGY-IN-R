#### SPECTRAL INDICES ####

# since these bands are all correlated with each other, we can build SPECTRAL INDICES.

# taking into consideration the reflectance of red and NIR bands from a tree. 
# We are going to compare the NIR and the red value (which is supposed to be lower)

# The RANGE OF REFLECTANCE is from 0 to 255
# because reflectance is the ratio between the incident flux of energy and the reflected flux.

# We want to avoid floating-point numbers because they require space in our computer
# to avoid them we should use bits: 1 bit = or 0 or 1 -> the BINARY CODE
# The binary code can be used to build all the information in the computer
# (1 bit = 2 information: 0 or 1; 2 bits= 4 information: 00, 01, 10, 11; 3 bits= 8 info and so on)
# Most of the images are stored in 8-bit -> it permits the storage of a lot of information 
# but reducing the storage space that is required

# DVI = DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX -> the difference between the total bits and the REDs 
# DVI = difference between NIR and RED

#### NDVI ####

# we can standardize the DVI: Normalization -> performed to compare data
# DVI = NIR - RED
# NDVI = (NIR - RED)/(NIR + RED)

# The ranges of the indices are the same
# NDVI is always ranging from -1 to +1 since -1 = (0 - 255)/(0 + 255) and +1 = (255 - 0)/(255 + 0)
# DVI's range depends on the amount of data
# calculation is done pixel by pixel
