#### CLASSIFICATION OF PIXELS for Remote Sensing Data ####
                                      
# grouping pixels can be used to represent the final class on a graph with red, infrared and so on on the axes.
# The amount of pixels and the amount of proportion related to that.
# Vegetation area are reflective a lot in the infrared area (not in the red since they are doing photosynthesis)
# Water absorbs all the infrared light and may reflect red.
# These pixels are called TRAINING SITES, something that can explain to the software which clusters (or classes) are present.
# If we want to classify a pixel, without knowing its class, we must use the reflectance of the pixel
# and use the SMALLEST DISTANCE FROM THE NEAREST CLASS, to estimate to which class the pixel is most probable to be part of.
## This way, we can classify every pixel in the image by class.
